# Music-Genre-Guesser
This app will look at patterns in the spectrograms of songs categorized by genre. Then, given a brand new, unseen song, predict which genre it is.  
  
Optional addition:  
  
  Generate an image based on certain tags and heuristics that would best match the current song given a database of images.

# Installing Dependencies
### For Alex and Lucas
This project uses Python version 3.9.2  
Run the following in terminal (will not work in CMD, try powershell):

    python .venv venv
    .venv/Scripts/activate.bat
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

** Also, be sure to add ".venv/" to .gitignore!!! **  
  
If you use VSCode, use Ctrl + Shift + P then type in 'Python: Select Interpreter' and set to the recommended env it suggests.
